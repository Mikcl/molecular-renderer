# Diamond Rope

Author: Philip Turner

> NOTE: This nano-part is in progress.

Description: perfect example of something parametric.

Parameters:
- Length (Int) - measures the distance between two ends of the rope, typically several nanometers
- Height (Int) - measures the cross-section, typically several angstroms
- Width (Int) - measures the cross-section, typically several angstroms

Improvements: a variant could be made using hexagonal diamond, which interfaces directly with (111) surfaces. At the time of creation, the software for designing the rope did not support cubic diamond. The hexagonal diamond version would likely include only a "Radius (Float)" parameter, instead of two "Height" and "Width" parameters.
