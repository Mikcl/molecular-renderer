# Diamond Rope

Author: Philip Turner

> NOTE: This nano-part is in progress.

Description: perfect example of something parametric.

Parameters:
- Length: measures the distance between two ends of the rope, typically several nanometers
- Height: measures the cross-section, typically several angstroms
- Width: measures the cross-section, typically several angstroms

Improvements: a variant could be made using hexagonal diamond, which interfaces directly with (111) surfaces. At the time of creation, the software for designing the rope did not support cubic diamond.
