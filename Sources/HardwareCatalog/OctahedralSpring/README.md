# Octahedral Spring

Author: Philip Turner

> NOTE: This nano-part is in progress.

Description: originated from the constraint of building springs with only (100) and (110) surfaces of cubic diamond, and no sharp corners (5-carbon rings). The top and bottom of the spring do not include a shaped interface to other parts. You must design an interface and covalently weld using CSG. The images show one possible interface created in external code.

Parameters:
- Number of stacks

Improvements: a variant could use only one of 4 legs, for reduced atom count. However, that design may be more susceptible to sideways sagging.
