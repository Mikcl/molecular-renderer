**Human:**

 I want to make a Mac app (written in Swift) that accepts keyboard and mouse input. It will use the input to let me move around inside a 3D environment. How do I get started doing this?

***

**Assistant:**

That sounds like an interesting project. To get started, you will need to learn how to use the **UIKit** framework to handle keyboard and mouse input in your Mac app</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/keyboards_and_input). You will also need to learn how to work with **pointer movement**, **pointer locking**, **scroll input** and **trackpad gestures**</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10094/). You can use the **CGEvent** class to create and post mouse events programmatically</a>[<sup>3</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41908620/how-to-simulate-mouse-click-from-mac-app-to-other-application). You can use the **NSFileHandle** class to read input from the keyboard in a command-line application</a>[<sup>4</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24004776/input-from-the-keyboard-in-command-line-application). You will also need to learn how to create a 3D environment using a graphics library such as **Metal** or **SceneKit**. I hope this helps you get started.😊

**Human:**

 Is there anything in UIKit that reports keyboard inputs?

***

**Assistant:**

Yes, there are some methods in UIKit that report keyboard input. You can use the **pressesBegan()** and **pressesEnded()** methods to detect when the user presses and releases keys on a physical keyboard</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-detect-keyboard-input-using-pressesbegan-and-pressesended). You can also use the **UIKeyInput** protocol to implement simple text entry</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/keyboards_and_input). You can inspect the **key codes** and **modifiers** of the keyboard events using the **UIPress** class</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-detect-keyboard-input-using-pressesbegan-and-pressesended). You can also use the **UITextInput** protocol to enable features such as autocorrect and multistage text input</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/keyboards_and_input). I hope this answers your question.😊

**Human:**

 How do I write some Swift code that uses UIKit's keyboard input functionality, and prints out a string of the keys pressed?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to write some Swift code that uses UIKit’s keyboard input functionality and prints out a string of the keys pressed is:

```
import UIKit

class KeyboardViewController: UIInputViewController {

    // A string to store the keys pressed
    var inputString = ""

    // A label to display the input string
    var inputLabel: UILabel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create and configure the label
        inputLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.bounds.width, height: 50))
        inputLabel.textAlignment = .center
        inputLabel.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 24)
        inputLabel.text = inputString

        // Add the label to the view
        view.addSubview(inputLabel)
    }

    // Override the pressesBegan method to handle keyboard events
    override func pressesBegan(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
        super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)

        // Loop through the presses
        for press in presses {
            // Get the key code and modifier flags of the press
            if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode, let modifierFlags = press.key?.modifierFlags {
                // Append the key code and modifier flags to the input string
                inputString += "\(keyCode) \(modifierFlags) "
                // Update the label text
                inputLabel.text = inputString
                // Print the input string to the console
                print(inputString)
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 In a 3D app such as Minecraft, the user typically holds W, A, S, D to move forward, left, backward, right. They also need to hold the key and keep it pressed down for the duration of the movement. How do I make some code that implements this functionality?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to write some Swift code that implements this functionality is:

```
import UIKit
import SceneKit

class KeyboardViewController: UIInputViewController {

    // A scene view to display the 3D environment
    var sceneView: SCNView!

    // A node to represent the camera
    var cameraNode: SCNNode!

    // A node to represent the player
    var playerNode: SCNNode!

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool] = [:]

    // A timer to update the player movement
    var movementTimer: Timer?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create and configure the scene view
        sceneView = SCNView(frame: view.bounds)
        sceneView.scene = SCNScene()
        sceneView.allowsCameraControl = true
        sceneView.showsStatistics = true

        // Add the scene view to the view
        view.addSubview(sceneView)

        // Create and configure the camera node
        cameraNode = SCNNode()
        cameraNode.camera = SCNCamera()
        cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 5, z: 10)

        // Add the camera node to the scene
        sceneView.scene?.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)

        // Create and configure the player node
        playerNode = SCNNode()
        playerNode.geometry = SCNSphere(radius: 1)
        playerNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 1, z: 0)

        // Add the player node to the scene
        sceneView.scene?.rootNode.addChildNode(playerNode)

        // Initialize the keys pressed dictionary with false values
        keysPressed[.keyboardW] = false
        keysPressed[.keyboardA] = false
        keysPressed[.keyboardS] = false
        keysPressed[.keyboardD] = false

        // Start the movement timer
        movementTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.1, repeats: true) { timer in
            self.updatePlayerMovement()
        }
    }

    // Override the pressesBegan method to handle keyboard events
    override func pressesBegan(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
        super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)

        // Loop through the presses
        for press in presses {
            // Get the key code of the press
            if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true
                keysPressed[keyCode] = true
            }
        }
    }

    // Override the pressesEnded method to handle keyboard events
    override func pressesEnded(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
        super.pressesEnded(presses, with: event)

        // Loop through the presses
        for press in presses {
            // Get the key code of the press
            if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to false
                keysPressed[keyCode] = false
            }
        }
    }

    // A method to update the player movement based on the keys pressed dictionary
    func updatePlayerMovement() {
        
        // Define a constant for the movement speed
        let speed: Float = 0.5

        // Check if W is pressed and move forward along the z-axis
        if keysPressed[.keyboardW] == true {
            playerNode.position.z -= speed
        }

        // Check if S is pressed and move backward along the z-axis
        if keysPressed[.keyboardS] == true {
            playerNode.position.z += speed
        }

        // Check if A is pressed and move left along the x-axis
        if keysPressed[.keyboardA] == true {
            playerNode.position.x -= speed
        }

        // Check if D is pressed and move right along the x-axis
        if keysPressed[.keyboardD] == true {
            playerNode.position.x += speed
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 Also, in Minecraft, you use the mouse to control your orientation. For example, moving the mouse pointer upward will cause you to look more upward. The orientation is based on azimuth and zenith angles. This is a bit complex of a thing to implement, so could you first elaborate a bit more on the subject matter?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure, I can try to elaborate a bit more on the subject matter. Mouse orientation is a way of controlling the direction that the camera or the player is facing in a 3D environment using the mouse movement. Azimuth and zenith are two angles that describe the orientation of a point in a spherical coordinate system. Azimuth is the horizontal angle measured clockwise from a reference direction, such as north. Zenith is the vertical angle measured from the zenith point, which is directly above the observer. For example, if you look straight up, your zenith angle is 0° and your azimuth angle can be any value. If you look straight ahead, your zenith angle is 90° and your azimuth angle depends on which direction you are facing. If you look straight down, your zenith angle is 180° and your azimuth angle can be any value again (see illustration 1</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/horizontal-coordinate-system.html)).


To implement mouse orientation in a 3D app, you need to track the mouse movement and use it to update the azimuth and zenith angles of the camera or the player. You also need to limit the range of these angles to avoid unnatural or undesired movements. For example, you may want to prevent the zenith angle from going below 0° or above 180°, or limit the azimuth angle to a certain range depending on the scene. You also need to convert these angles to a direction vector that can be used to orient the camera or the player in the 3D space. [This can be done using some trigonometric formulas (see illustration 2](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/horizontal-coordinate-system.html)[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/horizontal-coordinate-system.html)).


I hope this gives you some idea of how mouse orientation works in a 3D app. If you want more details or examples, please let me know.😊



***

**Human:**

 Got it. How do I implement that in Swift?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to implement mouse orientation in Swift is:

```
import UIKit
import SceneKit

class MouseViewController: UIInputViewController {

    // A scene view to display the 3D environment
    var sceneView: SCNView!

    // A node to represent the camera
    var cameraNode: SCNNode!

    // A node to represent the player
    var playerNode: SCNNode!

    // The azimuth angle of the camera or the player in radians
    var azimuthAngle: CGFloat = 0

    // The zenith angle of the camera or the player in radians
    var zenithAngle: CGFloat = .pi / 2

    // The sensitivity of the mouse movement
    var sensitivity: CGFloat = 0.01

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create and configure the scene view
        sceneView = SCNView(frame: view.bounds)
        sceneView.scene = SCNScene()
        sceneView.allowsCameraControl = false
        sceneView.showsStatistics = true

        // Add the scene view to the view
        view.addSubview(sceneView)

        // Create and configure the camera node
        cameraNode = SCNNode()
        cameraNode.camera = SCNCamera()
        cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 5, z: 10)

        // Add the camera node to the scene
        sceneView.scene?.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)

        // Create and configure the player node
        playerNode = SCNNode()
        playerNode.geometry = SCNSphere(radius: 1)
        playerNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 1, z: 0)

        // Add the player node to the scene
        sceneView.scene?.rootNode.addChildNode(playerNode)

        // Add a gesture recognizer to handle mouse movement
        let panGestureRecognizer = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handlePanGesture(_:)))
        sceneView.addGestureRecognizer(panGestureRecognizer)
    }

    // A method to handle mouse movement and update the azimuth and zenith angles
    @objc func handlePanGesture(_ gestureRecognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
        
        // Get the translation of the mouse movement in points
        let translation = gestureRecognizer.translation(in: sceneView)

        // Update the azimuth angle by adding the horizontal translation multiplied by the sensitivity
        azimuthAngle += translation.x * sensitivity

        // Update the zenith angle by subtracting the vertical translation multiplied by the sensitivity
        zenithAngle -= translation.y * sensitivity

        // Limit the zenith angle to a range between 0 and pi radians to prevent flipping
        zenithAngle = max(0, min(.pi, zenithAngle))

        // Convert the azimuth and zenith angles to a direction vector using trigonometric formulas
        let directionX = sin(azimuthAngle) * sin(zenithAngle)
        let directionY = cos(zenithAngle)
        let directionZ = cos(azimuthAngle) * sin(zenithAngle)
        let direction = SCNVector3(x: directionX, y: directionY, z: directionZ)

        // Orient the camera or the player node to face the direction vector
        cameraNode.look(at: direction)
        playerNode.look(at: direction)

        // Reset the translation of the gesture recognizer
        gestureRecognizer.setTranslation(.zero, in: sceneView)
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 I'd like a crosshair, sort of like Minecraft, that sometimes is overlaid over the 3D view. It is sort of transparent; it inverts the pixels' colors to stand out from the neighboring pixels. Is it possible to implement this idea using SwiftUI?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to implement this idea using SwiftUI is:

```
import SwiftUI
import SceneKit

struct CrosshairView: View {

    // A scene view to display the 3D environment
    var sceneView: SCNView

    // A state variable to control the visibility of the crosshair
    @State var showCrosshair = true

    // A constant for the size of the crosshair
    let crosshairSize: CGFloat = 20

    var body: some View {
        // A ZStack to overlay the crosshair over the scene view
        ZStack {
            // A UIViewRepresentable to wrap the scene view
            SceneViewRepresentable(sceneView: sceneView)

            // A conditional view to show or hide the crosshair
            if showCrosshair {
                // A crosshair shape with a blend mode that inverts the background color
                CrosshairShape()
                    .frame(width: crosshairSize, height: crosshairSize)
                    .blendMode(.difference)
            }
        }
        // A gesture modifier to toggle the crosshair visibility on tap
        .onTapGesture {
            showCrosshair.toggle()
        }
    }
}

// A UIViewRepresentable to wrap a SCNView in SwiftUI
struct SceneViewRepresentable: UIViewRepresentable {

    // The SCNView to wrap
    var sceneView: SCNView

    // A method to make the UIView
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -&gt; SCNView {
        return sceneView
    }

    // A method to update the UIView
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: SCNView, context: Context) {
        // Do nothing
    }
}

// A Shape to draw a crosshair
struct CrosshairShape: Shape {

    // A method to draw a crosshair path in a given rect
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -&gt; Path {
        var path = Path()

        // Get the center point of the rect
        let center = CGPoint(x: rect.midX, y: rect.midY)

        // Get the half width and height of the rect
        let halfWidth = rect.width / 2
        let halfHeight = rect.height / 2

        // Define a constant for the gap between the lines
        let gap: CGFloat = 2

        // Draw four lines from the center point to the edges of the rect with a gap in between
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x - halfWidth, y: center.y))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x - gap, y: center.y))
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x + gap, y: center.y))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x + halfWidth, y: center.y))
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x, y: center.y - halfHeight))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x, y: center.y - gap))
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x, y: center.y + gap))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x, y: center.y + halfHeight))

        return path
    }
}
```

**Human:**

 Say that I have a ray pointing from the origin to a direction in world space. The user it looking inside camera space, which is oriented from the azimuth and zenith angles. How do I make a 3x3 matrix that transforms the ray from world space to camera space?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to make a 3x3 matrix that transforms the ray from world space to camera space is:

```
// Assume that the world space axes are x, y, z and the camera space axes are u, v, w
// Assume that the azimuth angle is a and the zenith angle is b
// Assume that the ray direction in world space is r = (rx, ry, rz) and in camera space is s = (su, sv, sw)

// The transformation matrix can be obtained by multiplying two rotation matrices: one for azimuth and one for zenith
// The azimuth rotation matrix rotates the world space axes around the y-axis by -a radians
// The zenith rotation matrix rotates the camera space axes around the u-axis by -b radians

// The azimuth rotation matrix is:
M_a = [[cos(-a), 0, sin(-a)],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [-sin(-a), 0, cos(-a)]]

// The zenith rotation matrix is:
M_b = [[1, 0, 0],
       [0, cos(-b), -sin(-b)],
       [0, sin(-b), cos(-b)]]

// The transformation matrix is:
M = M_b * M_a = [[cos(-a), -sin(-a) * sin(-b), sin(-a) * cos(-b)],
                  [sin(-a), cos(-a) * sin(-b), -cos(-a) * cos(-b)],
                  [0, cos(-b), sin(-b)]]

// To transform the ray direction from world space to camera space, we multiply it by the transformation matrix:
s = M * r = [[cos(-a), -sin(-a) * sin(-b), sin(-a) * cos(-b)],
              [sin(-a), cos(-a) * sin(-b), -cos(-a) * cos(-b)],
              [0, cos(-b), sin(-b)]] * [rx, ry, rz] = [su, sv, sw]
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 I'm accessing UIKit from SwiftUI via the UIViewRepresentable protocol. How do I modify the code to accept keyboard inputs with this different approach?

***

**Assistant:**

One possible way to modify the code to accept keyboard inputs with this different approach is:

```
import SwiftUI
import SceneKit

struct SceneView: UIViewRepresentable {

    // A scene view to display the 3D environment
    var sceneView: SCNView

    // A node to represent the camera
    var cameraNode: SCNNode

    // A node to represent the player
    var playerNode: SCNNode

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]

    // A timer to update the player movement
    var movementTimer: Timer?

    // A method to make the UIView
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -&gt; SCNView {
        return sceneView
    }

    // A method to update the UIView
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: SCNView, context: Context) {
        // Do nothing
    }

    // A method to make a coordinator object that handles keyboard events
    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {
        return Coordinator(self)
    }

    // A class that conforms to UIResponder and acts as a coordinator for keyboard events
    class Coordinator: UIResponder {

        // A reference to the parent view
        var parent: SceneView

        // An initializer that takes a parent view as an argument
        init(_ parent: SceneView) {
            self.parent = parent
            super.init()
            // Become the first responder to receive keyboard events
            self.becomeFirstResponder()
        }

        // A property that indicates whether the object can become the first responder
        override var canBecomeFirstResponder: Bool {
            return true
        }

        // A method to handle keyboard events when a key is pressed
        override func pressesBegan(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
            super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)

            // Loop through the presses
            for press in presses {
                // Get the key code of the press
                if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                    // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true
                    parent.keysPressed[keyCode] = true
                }
            }
        }

        // A method to handle keyboard events when a key is released
        override func pressesEnded(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
            super.pressesEnded(presses, with: event)

            // Loop through the presses
            for press in presses {
                // Get the key code of the press
                if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                    // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to false
                    parent.keysPressed[keyCode] = false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 On Mac, is there an AppKit equivalent of UIKeyboardHIDUsage?

***

**Assistant:**

According to the search results, there is no direct equivalent of UIKeyboardHIDUsage in AppKit. However, there is a Swift package called KeyCodes</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://swiftpackageregistry.com/ChimeHQ/KeyCodes) that provides versions of UIKey, UIKeyboardHIDUsage, and UIKeyModifierFlags that work with AppKit’s NSEvent. You can use this package to handle keyboard inputs with AppKit in a similar way as UIKit. To use this package, you need to add it as a dependency to your project using Swift Package Manager. Then, you can import it in your code and use the KeyCodes namespace to access the types and values. For example:

```
import SwiftUI
import SceneKit
import KeyCodes

struct SceneView: UIViewRepresentable {

    // A scene view to display the 3D environment
    var sceneView: SCNView

    // A node to represent the camera
    var cameraNode: SCNNode

    // A node to represent the player
    var playerNode: SCNNode

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]

    // A timer to update the player movement
    var movementTimer: Timer?

    // A method to make the UIView
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -&gt; SCNView {
        return sceneView
    }

    // A method to update the UIView
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: SCNView, context: Context) {
        // Do nothing
    }

    // A method to make a coordinator object that handles keyboard events
    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {
        return Coordinator(self)
    }

    // A class that conforms to UIResponder and acts as a coordinator for keyboard events
    class Coordinator: UIResponder {

        // A reference to the parent view
        var parent: SceneView

        // An initializer that takes a parent view as an argument
        init(_ parent: SceneView) {
            self.parent = parent
            super.init()
            // Become the first responder to receive keyboard events
            self.becomeFirstResponder()
        }

        // A property that indicates whether the object can become the first responder
        override var canBecomeFirstResponder: Bool {
            return true
        }

        // A method to handle keyboard events when a key is pressed
        override func pressesBegan(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
            super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)

            // Loop through the presses
            for press in presses {
                // Get the key code of the press using KeyCodes.UIKey extension
                if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                    // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
                    parent.keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = true
                }
            }
        }

        // A method to handle keyboard events when a key is released
        override func pressesEnded(_ presses: Set&lt;UIPress&gt;, with event: UIPressesEvent?) {
            super.pressesEnded(presses, with: event)

            // Loop through the presses
            for press in presses {
                // Get the key code of the press using KeyCodes.UIKey extension
                if let keyCode = press.key?.keyCode {
                    // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to false using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
                    parent.keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 AppKit also seems to lack an equivalent for UIPress. However, NSResponder has a method `func interpretKeyEvents(_ eventArray: [NSEvent])`. Can this and/or other methods be used for my purposes?

***

**Assistant:**

According to the search results, the interpretKeyEvents(<em>:) method of NSResponder</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/1531599-interpretkeyevents) can be used to handle a series of key events. This method takes an array of NSEvent objects and passes them to the appropriate action methods based on the type and characters of the events. For example, if the event represents a key press, the method calls insertText(</em>:replacementRange:), and if the event represents a function key press, the method calls moveUp(<em>:) or moveDown(</em>:), depending on the key. You can override these action methods in your subclass of NSResponder to customize the behavior of your app. For example:

```
import AppKit

class KeyboardResponder: NSResponder {

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]

    // An initializer that takes a keys pressed dictionary as an argument
    init(keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]) {
        self.keysPressed = keysPressed
        super.init()
    }

    // A required initializer that is not implemented
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    // A method to handle key press events
    override func insertText(_ insertString: Any, replacementRange: NSRange) {
        // Get the string representation of the insert string
        if let string = insertString as? String {
            // Get the first character of the string
            if let character = string.first {
                // Get the key code of the character using KeyCodes.UIKey extension
                if let keyCode = KeyCodes.UIKey(character: character)?.keyCode {
                    // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
                    keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = true
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // A method to handle key release events
    override func doCommand(by selector: Selector) {
        // Check if the selector is deleteBackward(_:)
        if selector == #selector(deleteBackward(_:)) {
            // Set the value for keyboardDeleteOrBackspace in the keys pressed dictionary to false
            keysPressed[.keyboardDeleteOrBackspace] = false
        }
    }

    // A method to handle function key press events
    override func moveUp(_ sender: Any?) {
        // Set the value for keyboardUpArrow in the keys pressed dictionary to true
        keysPressed[.keyboardUpArrow] = true
    }

    // A method to handle function key release events
    override func moveDown(_ sender: Any?) {
        // Set the value for keyboardDownArrow in the keys pressed dictionary to false
        keysPressed[.keyboardDownArrow] = false
    }

    // Other action methods can be overridden similarly ...
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 Thanks for the suggestion. Is it also possible to process the keys using the NSEvent directly?

***

**Assistant:**
According to the search results, it is possible to process the keys using the NSEvent directly. The NSEvent class has several properties and methods that can be used to get information about the key events. For example:



- The type property returns the event type, which can be NSKeyDown, NSKeyUp, or NSFlagsChanged for keyboard events.

- The characters property returns a string of characters associated with the key event. Though most key events contain only one character, it is possible for a single keypress to generate a series of characters.

- The charactersIgnoringModifiers property returns a string of characters generated by the key event as if no modifier key had been pressed (except for Shift). This property is useful for getting the “basic” key value in a hardware-independent manner.

- The keyCode property returns a number that identifies the keyboard key associated with the key event. Its value is hardware-independent.

- The modifierFlags property returns an integer bit field containing any of the modifier key masks described in Getting Unicode Values, combined using the C bitwise OR operator.

- The isARepeat property returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the key event is a repeat caused by the user holding the key down.




You can use these properties and methods to process the keys in your app logic. For example:

```
import AppKit

class KeyboardResponder: NSResponder {

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]

    // An initializer that takes a keys pressed dictionary as an argument
    init(keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]) {
        self.keysPressed = keysPressed
        super.init()
    }

    // A required initializer that is not implemented
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    // A method to handle key events
    override func keyDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        super.keyDown(with: event)

        // Get the event type
        let type = event.type

        // Check if the event type is NSKeyDown
        if type == .keyDown {
            // Get the key code of the event
            let keyCode = event.keyCode

            // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
            keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = true
        }
    }

    // A method to handle key events
    override func keyUp(with event: NSEvent) {
        super.keyUp(with: event)

        // Get the event type
        let type = event.type

        // Check if the event type is NSKeyUp
        if type == .keyUp {
            // Get the key code of the event
            let keyCode = event.keyCode

            // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to false using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
            keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = false
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊

**Human:**

 The NSEvent seems to not be reporting the key code for left shift, when I press left shift. Therefore, with the current code, I cannot detect when the user pressures left shift. How do I remedy this?

***

**Assistant:**

According to the search results, the NSEvent does not report the key code for left shift when you press left shift, because it is a modifier key. Instead, it reports a change in the modifier flags property, which is an integer bit field containing any of the modifier key masks described in Getting Unicode Values</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2080312/where-can-i-find-a-list-of-key-codes-for-use-with-cocoas-nsevent-class), combined using the C bitwise OR operator. To detect when the user presses left shift, you need to check the value of the modifier flags property and compare it with the NSEvent.ModifierFlag.shift mask. For example:

```
import AppKit

class KeyboardResponder: NSResponder {

    // A dictionary to store the keys pressed and their states
    var keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]

    // An initializer that takes a keys pressed dictionary as an argument
    init(keysPressed: [KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage: Bool]) {
        self.keysPressed = keysPressed
        super.init()
    }

    // A required initializer that is not implemented
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    // A method to handle key events
    override func keyDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        super.keyDown(with: event)

        // Get the event type
        let type = event.type

        // Check if the event type is NSKeyDown
        if type == .keyDown {
            // Get the key code of the event
            let keyCode = event.keyCode

            // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to true using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
            keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = true
        }
    }

    // A method to handle key events
    override func keyUp(with event: NSEvent) {
        super.keyUp(with: event)

        // Get the event type
        let type = event.type

        // Check if the event type is NSKeyUp
        if type == .keyUp {
            // Get the key code of the event
            let keyCode = event.keyCode

            // Set the corresponding value in the keys pressed dictionary to false using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
            keysPressed[KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(keyCode)] = false
        }
    }

    // A method to handle modifier flags change events
    override func flagsChanged(with event: NSEvent) {
        super.flagsChanged(with: event)

        // Get the modifier flags of the event
        let flags = event.modifierFlags

        // Check if the shift flag is set and if it is left shift using KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage enum
        if flags.contains(.shift) &amp;&amp; KeyCodes.UIKeyboardHIDUsage(event.keyCode) == .keyboardLeftShift {
            // Set the value for keyboardLeftShift in the keys pressed dictionary to true
            keysPressed[.keyboardLeftShift] = true
        } else {
            // Set the value for keyboardLeftShift in the keys pressed dictionary to false
            keysPressed[.keyboardLeftShift] = false
        }
    }
}
```


This is just an example and you may need to modify it according to your needs. I hope this helps you.😊
