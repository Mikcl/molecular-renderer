## Syntax

### Lattice Editing

```swift
protocol Basis
Cubic: Basis
Hexagonal: Basis
```

Coordinate spaces for defining vectors in.

```swift
Bounds { SIMD3<Float> }
Bounds { 10 * h + 10 * k + 10 * l } // cubic
Bounds { 10 * h + 10 * (h + 2 * k) + 10 * l } // hexagonal
```

Sets the working set of crystal unit cells. The box spans from the world origin `[0, 0, 0]` the specified vector. This must be called in the top-level scope, before any `Volume` keywords.

For hexagonal crystals, the bounds are a cuboid defined by transforming the input vector. It is mapped from h/k/l space to h/h2k/l space. This allows the base lattice to be cartesian, similar to cubic. The quantity in each axis direction must be an integer.

```swift
Constant(ConstantType) { MaterialType }
ConstantType.hexagon // Hexagonal - hexagon side length
ConstantType.prism   // Hexagonal - prism height
ConstantType.square  // Cubic - square side length

// Query the lattice constant for diamond.
let latticeConstant = Constant(.square) { .elemental(.carbon) }
```

Values of the lattice constants, for use in `Solid`. The hexagonal lattice constants are changed from the empirical values, so that (111) surfaces perfectly align with cubic lattices. This change allows for objects with heterogeneous crystal phases.

```swift
// Lattice vectors originate from the smallest repeatable unit of crystal. For
// cubic crystals, they are edges of a cube. For hexagonal crystals, they are
// sides of a hexagonal prism. The vectors aren't always orthogonal, so they are
// internally translated to nanometers before applying affine transforms.

// Hexagonal crystals are sometimes described with four unit vectors: h, k, i,
// and l. The 'i' vector is redundant and equals -h - k, creating a set of 3
// vectors symmetric around the perimeter of a hexagon. However, for the HDL, it
// can make representation more concise.
Lattice<Hexagonal> { h, k, l in
  // h + k + i == 0
  let i = -h - k
}

// Another helpful technique, which makes Hexagonal more similar to Cubic, is to
// replace 'k' with something orthogonal to 'h'. The coordinate basis has
// changed from h/k/l to h/h + 2k/l.
Lattice<Hexagonal> { h, k, l in
  // [3 * h, 2 * h2k, 2 * l] forms something close to a cube.
  let h2k = h + 2 * k
  ...
  
  Volume {
    Plane { -h }
    Plane { -h2k }
    Plane { -l }
    
    Origin { 3 * h + 2 * (h2k + l) }
    Plane { +h }
    Plane { +h2k }
    Plane { +l }
    ...
  }
}
```

Unit vectors representing the crystal's basis.

```swift
Material { MaterialType }
```

Specifies the atom types to fill the lattice with, and the lattice constant. This must be called in the top-level scope, and may not be called after an `Affine` or `Copy`.

### Objects

```swift
Entity
EntityType
```

A wrapper type encapsulating atoms and bond connectors. The `Entity` includes position (12 bytes) and entity type (4 bytes). `EntityType` can extract information about the type, such as atomic number or bond order. Zero for the entity type indicates `.empty`.

Internally, empty entities are often used to pad vector lengths to multiples of 8. This enables greater CPU vector parallelism without the overhead of bounds checking. Replacing atoms with empty entities also deletes existing atoms.

The compiler supports all atom types in the [MM4 simulator](https://github.com/philipturner/MM4) (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Ge).

```swift
Lattice<Basis> { h, k, l in
  Material { ... }
  Bounds { ... }
}
```

Create a lattice of crystal unit cells to edit. Coordinates are represented in numbers of crystal unit cells. The coordinate system may be mapped to a non-orthonormal coordinate system internally. Keep this in mind when processing `SIMD3<Float>` vectors. For example, avoid normalizing any vectors.

```swift
Solid { x, y, z in
  Affine {
    Copy { Lattice<Basis> }
  }
}
Solid { x, y, z in
  Affine {
    Copy { Solid }
  }
}
```

Create a solid object composed of multiple lattices or other solids. Converts coordinates inside a crystal unit cell to nanometers.

### Scopes

```swift
Affine {
  // Perform any number of affine transforms (optional).
  // Finally, call 'Copy' to add atoms that undergo the specified order of
  // transforms.
}
```

Starts a section that instantiates a previously designed object, then rotates or translates it. This may not be called inside a `Volume` or another `Affine`.

> TODO: Accumulate the affine transforms into a 3x3 matrix, then apply to the copied positions. Simply pass all 3 cardinal axes through the transformation sequence, then create a matrix from the results. The transformations can be applied eagerly, instead of buffering them up for lazy evaluation.
>
> Whenever Warp operators occur, break up the transformation around the warps. Apply each transformation to the entire object before proceeding with the next one.

```swift
Concave { }
```

Scope where every plane's "one" volume merges through AND in [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form). Upon exiting this scope, the added planes remain. This must be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Convex { }
```

Scope where every plane's "one" volume merges through OR in [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form). Upon exiting this scope, the added planes remain. This must be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Volume { }
```

Encapsulates a set of planes, so that everything inside the scope is removed from the stack upon exiting. This is permitted inside both `Lattice` and `Solid`. This may not be called inside `Affine`, but may be called inside another `Volume`.

### Solid Editing

The following keywords may only be called inside an `Affine`.

```swift
Copy { Lattice<Basis> }
Copy { Solid }
Copy { [Entity] }
```

Instantiates a previously designed object. The array initializer accepts raw atom positions in nanometers. This may not be called in the top-level scope.

When two entities in the new structure are extremely close, one will be overwritten. The entity that survives is decided by the following priority list:
1. Highest valence.
2. Highest bond order.
3. Otherwise, the original atom wins. This rule prevents the atoms from drifting when several small modifications are performed.

```swift
Reflect { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Reflects the object across the origin (`.zero`), along the specified axis.

```swift
Rotate { SIMD4(axis, rotations) }
```

Rotate the object counterclockwise about the origin (`.zero`). The number of rotations is the specified in revolutions (multiples of 2Ï€ radians).

The first 3 vector components are the direction; the fourth is the rotation. For example, enter `SIMD4(x + y + z, 0.25)` for 0.25 revolutions (90 degrees). The rotation occurs around the world origin `.zero`.

All direction vectors are `SIMD3` and must be converted to `SIMD4`. 4-wide SIMD vectors may be instantiated using the first three components (xyz, a `SIMD3<Float>`) and a fourth component (w, a `Float`). The initializer has the signature `SIMD4(SIMD3, Float)`. 

```swift
Translate { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Translate the object by the specified vector, relative to its current position.

```swift
Warp(direction) { axis }
```

Warp the object counterclockwise about `axis` and the origin (`.zero`). The object is treated as a beam, perpendicular to the warp direction. `axis` and `direction` are ideally perpendicular; the parallel component of `direction` is ignored. The length of `direction` equals the radius of curvative.

Before warping, one often needs to translate the object, so the desired warping center aligns with the origin. The object can extend in either direction from the origin; both sides will warp according to the same normal vector.

After warping, one often needs to translate the object back, by the negative of the warp direction. `Warp` does not perform this translation for you.

### Volume Editing

The following keywords may only be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Origin { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Translates the origin by a vector relative to the current origin. Modifications to the origin are undone when leaving the current scope. This may not be called in the top-level scope.

`Origin` may not be called inside `Affine`. Instead, use `Translate` to shift the center of rotation or reflection `.zero`.

```swift
Plane { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Adds a plane to the stack. The plane will be combined with other planes, and used for selecting/deleting atoms.

A `Plane` divides the `Bounds` into two sections. The "one" volume is the side the normal vector points toward. The "zero" volume is the side the normal points away from. The "one" volume contains the atoms deleted during a `Cut()`. When planes combine into a `Concave`, only the crystal unit cells common to every plane's "one" volume are deleted.

```swift
Ridge(SIMD3<Float>) { SIMD3<Float> }
Valley(SIMD3<Float>) { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Creates two planes by reflecting the first argument across the second argument. `Ridge` takes the union of the planes' "one" volumes, while `Valley` takes the intersection.

```swift
Replace { EntityType }
```

Replace all entities in the selected volume with a new entity. In the future, there may be an option to specify which atoms to preserve. The default is all non-empty atoms and bond connectors.

Instead of a dedicated keyword for cutting empty volumes, specify `Replace { .empty }`. Atoms deleted with a `Replace` cannot be restored by a subsequent `Replace`. The only method for filling in this geometry is creating a `Solid`, copying a separate piece of geometry that fills the void.

## Tips

List:
- Compile the Swift code in release mode with incremental compilation.
- Split into multiple files, decreasing the chance the compiler will take a long time compiling any one file.
